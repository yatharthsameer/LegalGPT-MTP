The legal document pertains to an application under Section 482 of the Cr.P.C. seeking to quash the charge sheet dated 29.05.2020 and the proceedings of Criminal Case No. 462 of 2021, involving multiple charges including Sections 153-A, 420, 429, 188, 269, 270, 273 of the IPC, the Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, and the Environment (Protection) Act. The applicants, represented by Senior Advocate Sri N.I. Jafri, argued that they were falsely implicated, highlighting a forensic report indicating the meat recovered was not cow meat. However, the State, represented by Sri Roopak Chaubey, contended that 16 live cattle were also found in the applicants' possession without a slaughterhouse license. The court, referencing precedents such as R.P. Kapur vs. State of Punjab and State of Haryana vs. Bhajan Lal, emphasized that the power to quash proceedings should be exercised sparingly and only in exceptional cases where no offence is made out. The court found that a prima facie cognizable offence was established and dismissed the application, noting that the applicants' defense could be considered during the trial. The ruling underscores the court's reluctance to interfere at an interlocutory stage unless the allegations are manifestly absurd or maliciously instituted.
