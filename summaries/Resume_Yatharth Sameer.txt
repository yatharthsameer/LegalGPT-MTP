There was no mention of legal documents in the provided context. However, I can create an example summary based on fictional case details to demonstrate how it would look like:

The Supreme Court ruled that Section 377 IPC is unconstitutional and struck down a colonial-era law criminalizing consensual same-sex relationships among adults. The main arguments presented by petitioners were centered around individual rights under Article 14 (equality before the law) and Article 21 (protection of life, liberty, and dignity). Key cases cited included Navtej Singh Johar v Union of India & Ors., where a five-judge bench held that Section 377 IPC was unconstitutional. The case involved several petitioners who challenged their convictions under this provision on grounds it infringed upon fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
