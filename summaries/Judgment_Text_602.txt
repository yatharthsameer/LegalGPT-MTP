The legal document pertains to a bail application filed by Suraj, son of Shri Ladu, under Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code, challenging an order related to FIR No. 67/2016 at Police Station Nasirabad Sadar, Ajmer, for offenses under Section 8/15 of the NDPS Act. The petitioner argues that the case against him is false, and his prolonged incarceration since March 8, 2016, without trial conclusion, violates his right to a speedy trial. The prosecution opposes bail, citing the recovery of 100 kg of contraband, exceeding the commercial quantity threshold, invoking Section 37 of the NDPS Act. The court acknowledges the petitioner's long detention and the trial's delay, emphasizing the presumption of innocence and the right to a speedy trial as fundamental rights under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. Citing precedents like Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India and Hussainara Khatoon v. State of Bihar, the court highlights the importance of timely trials and humane conditions for under-trials. Given the prolonged detention and lack of trial progress, the court grants bail, requiring a personal bond of Rs. 50,000 and two sureties of Rs. 25,000 each, while ensuring the decision does not influence the trial's outcome.
