The case of Thyssen Krupp Industries India Private Limited & Ors. vs. Suresh Maruti Chougule & Ors. was heard by the Supreme Court of India on October 4, 2023, with a bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul, C.T. Ravikumar, and Sudhanshu Dhulia. The primary issue was whether the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, specifically Section 36(4), which restricts representation by legal practitioners in industrial disputes, needed reconsideration. The appellants challenged the constitutional validity of these provisions, arguing they resulted in discrimination. The case referenced the precedent set in Paradip Port Trust vs. Their Workmen (1977), which allowed certain legal practitioners to represent parties under specific conditions. The court upheld the established legal position, emphasizing the special nature of the Industrial Disputes Act over the general provisions of the Advocates Act, 1961. The appeal was dismissed as the matter had been compromised, and the writ petition challenging the constitutional validity was also dismissed. The case involved multiple civil appeals and writ petitions, with various legal representatives for both appellants and respondents. The procedural history included prior judgments and appeals, but the specific details of lower court proceedings were not elaborated.
