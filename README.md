# 🔒 PrivateGPT 📑

![Gradio UI](/fern/docs/assets/ui.png?raw=true)

LegalGPT is a production-ready AI project that allows you to ask questions about your documents using the power
of Large Language Models (LLMs), even in scenarios without an Internet connection. 100% private, no data leaves your
execution environment at any point.


The API is divided into two logical blocks:

**High-level API**, which abstracts all the complexity of a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
pipeline implementation:
- Ingestion of documents: internally managing document parsing,
splitting, metadata extraction, embedding generation and storage.
- Chat & Completions using context from ingested documents:
abstracting the retrieval of context, the prompt engineering and the response generation.

**Low-level API**, which allows advanced users to implement their own complex pipelines:
- Embeddings generation: based on a piece of text.
- Contextual chunks retrieval: given a query, returns the most relevant chunks of text from the ingested documents.

In addition to this, a working [Gradio UI](https://www.gradio.app/)
client is provided to test the API, together with a set of useful tools such as bulk model
download script, ingestion script, documents folder watch, etc.

### Motivation behind PrivateGPT
Generative AI is a game changer for our society, but adoption in companies of all sizes and data-sensitive
domains like healthcare or legal is limited by a clear concern: **privacy**.
Not being able to ensure that your data is fully under your control when using third-party AI tools
is a risk those industries cannot take.

### Primordial version
The first version of LegalGPT was launched in May 2023 as a novel approach to address the privacy
concerns by using LLMs in a complete offline way.

That version, which rapidly became a go-to project for privacy-sensitive setups and served as the seed
for thousands of local-focused generative AI projects, was the foundation of what LegalGPT is becoming nowadays;
thus a simpler and more educational implementation to understand the basic concepts required
to build a fully local -and therefore, private- chatGPT-like tool.

If you want to keep experimenting with it, we have saved it in the
[primordial branch](https://github.com/zylon-ai/private-gpt/tree/primordial) of the project.

> It is strongly recommended to do a clean clone and install of this new version of
LegalGPT if you come from the previous, primordial version.

### Present and Future of LegalGPT
LegalGPT is now evolving towards becoming a gateway to generative AI models and primitives, including
completions, document ingestion, RAG pipelines and other low-level building blocks.
We want to make it easier for any developer to build AI applications and experiences, as well as provide
a suitable extensive architecture for the community to keep contributing.

## 🧩 Architecture
Conceptually, LegalGPT is an API that wraps a RAG pipeline and exposes its
primitives.
* The API is built using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and follows
  [OpenAI's API scheme](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference).
* The RAG pipeline is based on [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/).

The design of LegalGPT allows to easily extend and adapt both the API and the
RAG implementation. Some key architectural decisions are:
* Dependency Injection, decoupling the different components and layers.
* Usage of LlamaIndex abstractions such as `LLM`, `BaseEmbedding` or `VectorStore`,
  making it immediate to change the actual implementations of those abstractions.
* Simplicity, adding as few layers and new abstractions as possible.
* Ready to use, providing a full implementation of the API and RAG
  pipeline.
